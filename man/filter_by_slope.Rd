\usage{
filter_by_slope(
  screenR_Object,
  genes,
  group_var,
  slope_control = NULL,
  slope_treatment
)
}
\arguments{
\item{screenR_Object}{The ScreenR object obtained using the
create_screenR_object}

\item{genes}{The genes for which the slope as to be computed. Those genes are
the result of the three statistical methods selection}

\item{group_var}{The variable to use as X for the linear model}

\item{slope_control}{The control slope}

\item{slope_treatment}{The treatment slope}

\description{
This function is used to improve the quality of the hits.
             It computes a regression line in the different samples ad uses
             the slope of this line to see the trend
