The aim of ScreenR is to help in the analysis of High Throughput
Biological Screening using pooled shRNAs. Those type of screening uses
RNA-seq expression data to find candidate hits. ScreenR tries to combine
together the power of software like edgeR with the semplicity of package
like the metapackage Tydiverse. Using ScreenR a pipeline able to find
candidate hits can be applied oon RNA-seq data moreover it integrates a
wide range of visualization in order to shows the results obtained.
