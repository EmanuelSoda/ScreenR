# ScreenR


The aim of ScreenR is to help in the analysis of 
High Throughput Biological Screening using pooled shRNAs. Those
type of screening uses RNA-seq expression data to find candidate 
hits. ScreenR tries to combine together the power of software like edgeR with 
the semplicity of package like the metapackage Tydiverse. Using ScreenR a 
pipeline able to find candidate hits can  be applied oon RNA-seq data moreover 
it integrates a wide range of visualization in order to shows the results 
obtained.
