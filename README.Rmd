ScreenR is an easy and effective package to perform hits identification in loss of function High Throughput Biological Screening performed with shRNAs library. ScreenR combines the power of software like edgeR with the simplicity of the Tidyverse metapackage. ScreenR executes a pipeline able to find candidate hits from barcode counts data and integrates a wide range of visualization for each step of the analysis

## Installation instructions

Get the latest stable `R` release from [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/) note 
that you need to have `R 4.3` or greater to use `ScreenR`. Then install 
`ScreenR` from [Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/) using the following code:

```{r 'install', eval = FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages("BiocManager")
}

BiocManager::install("ScreenR")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/EmanuelSoda/ScreenR) with:

```{r 'install_dev', eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("EmanuelSoda/ScreenR")
```
